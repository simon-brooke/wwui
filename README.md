# wwui

A conversational user interface to Wildwood; but more broadly, a playground for experimenting with natural language user interaction

## Installation

Download from http://example.com/FIXME.

## Usage

**WARNING**: does not even nearly work yet, and may never do so. The value of this archive is probably mainly as something to mine for algorithms and ideas, especially for those doing natural language interpreteation and generation.

**WARNING**: nothing in this is stable. Nothing should be treated as an API. Feel free to steal ideas and code, but don't depend on `wwui` as a library.

### Concept

If `wwui` is ever finished and ever works, you will invoke it with:

    $ java -jar wwui-0.1.0-standalone.jar [args]

Where `args` specifies one or more knowledge sources, and, for each source, the names and possibly strategies of agents accessing that source. This might be in the form of arguments directly on the arg list but is more likely to be in the form of a path/url to a configuration file in EDN notation. After instantiating a [Wildwood](https://github.com/simon-brooke/wildwood) engine and linking the required knowledge sources, it will open what is effectively a read-eval-print loop (REPL) in which you can type natural language questions querying the knowledge source(s).
